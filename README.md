## 🧩 Quiz Game

A fun and interactive Python-based Quiz Game designed for practicing multiple-choice questions. This project is a beginner-friendly yet smart implementation, showcasing Python’s control structures, user input handling, and basic game logic.

✨ Features

🎯 Multiple-choice questions with instant feedback.

🧮 Score tracking system to evaluate performance.

⚡ Simple, lightweight, and easy to run in any Python environment.

🖥️ Beginner-friendly code – perfect for learning Python fundamentals.

🚀 My Unique Vision (Future Enhancements)

While developing this project, I identified areas where the game can be expanded into a bigger learning platform. These aren’t faults, but opportunities for creativity and growth:

🔹 Randomized Question Bank – Instead of fixed questions, load them from a file/database for variety.

🔹 Difficulty Levels – Add Easy, Medium, and Hard modes for a personalized challenge.

🔹 Leaderboard System – Track high scores and add a competitive edge.

🔹 Timer Mode ⏳ – Answer questions within a time limit for extra thrill.

🔹 GUI Version 🎨 – Build a Tkinter or PyGame interface for a more engaging user experience.

🔹 Case Sensitivity Improvement – As I noticed from earlier code feedback, it would be better to ensure answers follow a sentence case pattern (first letter capitalized). This makes the quiz both challenging and uniform.

## 🚀 Getting Started
